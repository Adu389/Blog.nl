    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hi, I'm Joseph Adu. I'm passionate about learning web design and sharing my journey with you.</p>
    <p>I've always been fascinated by technology and how things work. Through this blog, I hope to document my learning process and help others who are also starting out in web design.</p>
    <p>I've recently started to learn CSS and JavaScript. It's been an exciting journey so far. I'm constantly looking for new resources and tutorials to improve my skills.</p>
    <p>In addition to web design, I have a keen interest in digital art and photography. I love capturing moments and expressing creativity through my lens.</p>
    <p>If you have any tips or suggestions, feel free to reach out to me through the Contact page.</p>
